# How It's Made
Built with : 
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* React

This project was purposefully developed using TypeScript, Tailwind, and React to showcase my proficiency with these technologies.

# Lessons Learned
I've learned countless lessons that I'm proud of. Here's some lessons that I'd like to share: 

* Utilized TypeScript to enhance type safety and code maintainability, minimizing potential bugs and contributing to a more streamlined development process.
* Leveraged Tailwind CSS for its utility-first styling approach, which allows for rapid UI development while maintaining a focus on simplicity and consistency.
* Produced dynamic routes using React Router 6.26 that responds to user interactions, allowing seamless transitions between the applicationâ€™s diverse offerings.
* Designed and executed a strategy to defer the loading of non-critical resources at page load, allowing for quicker initial page renders and a more efficient use of bandwidth.
